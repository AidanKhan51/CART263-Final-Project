## Instructions & Details
Click on the TV on-top of the cabinet to create a form. Upload your own image, audio file, or video as well as a name and description to add it to the cabinet. Currently as a prototype, there is only one object in each cabinet drawer that can be updated by re-submitting the form. 
## Changelog since last prototype
•  Added form for users to upload their own files and text content. File types
are automatically sorted into their respective drawers and categorized with a
given title.
•  Fixed text formatting and scaled up resolution of models to make css
elements fit in a reasonable resolution. Added fonts and css styling to make all
HTML/CSS elements look cohesive.
•  Added TV Model to house drawer titles and form, as well as to add visual intrigue.
Model is connected to each drawer by wires that correspond to the different
types of files that could potentially be stored in each drawer. Hovering over a
drawer will also show that drawer’s name on the monitor.
• General UX fixes concerning camera placement
•  Commented code and organization fixes.
